Hillary s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?Dolly Kyle   who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated   published the claims about the Clinton couple s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.Bill and Hillary Clinton profess to have always been supporters of racial equality, but anecdotes published in a new book by his ex-lover claim otherwise.Bill was also sued several times by blacks and Hispanics for violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Behind the Reverend Jesse Jackson s back, the Clinton duo called him,  That G**damned n****r .Dolly claims the couple used the same insult toward Robert  Say  McIntosh, one of the leading African-American activists in Little Rock, Arkansas when Bill was governor. McIntosh was dogging Clinton about ongoing relationships with black prostitutes, q charge, she says, Bill never denied.Clinton never denied stories that he was having an ongoing relationship with one black prostitute as well as her friends. He did deny a rumor that he had fathered a child with a black prostitute while governor and took a DNA test that was reported as negative.Rumors of the trysts throughout Little Rock and were aided by  one prominent black female newscaster who used to brag openly around the television station about her relationship with the governor, although they were  only  indulging in oral sex .Bill Clinton and Dolly grew up with Jim Crow laws in place in the plantation mentality of the South and they were in full force during the 1950s and  60s.It was a segregated society in Hot Springs at that time. Black and white students went to different schools. In the movie theaters, black people had to watch the movie from a balcony, use separate bathrooms and water fountains. Signs that separated  WHITES  and  COLORED  were deadly serious and always enforced , Dolly writes.In Arkansas, everyone had to pay a $2 poll tax to vote, and the cost was a huge sum for many black people.The black vote was further diluted by  gerrymandering, a wide-spread practice of dividing electoral districts along racial lines to dilute the black vote .Not one black was voted into the Arkansas legislation in hundreds of elections.In the 1980s, Clinton was sued several times by blacks and Hispanics for violations of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and he lost every case.The district lines were redrawn under court order.Ben McGee was a black Democrat was elected to the state legislature in 1988. Clinton tried to replace McGee with a white Democrat of his choice, claims Dolly.The case went all the way to the Supreme Court was ruled 8-0 against Clinton and the Arkansas officials who challenged McGee s election.In the 1980s, Hispanics were moving into Arkansas in greater numbers and Clinton began racial profiling against Hispanics, she claims.He instituted the racial profiling program three years after his brother, Roger Clinton went to prison in 1985 for dealing cocaine. The program was initially part of his anti-drug program, although Roger s drug suppliers and buyers were white. For no good reason, Bill and Hillary decided to profile Hispanics as drug dealers,  Dolly writes.State troopers now had the authority to stop and search any vehicle remotely suspect of carrying drugs. Specifically, the troopers were to stop and search cars driven by Hispanics, especially those cars with Texas license plates. Clinton was sued in federal court for his Criminal Apprehension Program that was ruled unconstitutional. Billy threw one of his infamous temper tantrums about the ban on his racial profiling of Hispanics and he threatened to renew the racial profiling program in spite of the court s ruling , Dolly reports.

The following was reported by Press TV yesterday, but as yet, we cannot corroborate the story: The United States denies its special operations troops have taken over an airfield in northeastern Syria, near the country s border with Iraq and Turkey. A spokesman of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) said Friday that the military  denied that US forces have taken control of any airfield in Syria . However, a spokesperson for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told Al Jazeera earlier this week that the US special operations forces had taken over the airfield near the city of Rmeilan in Syria s Hasakah province to support Kurdish fighters against the Daesh (ISIL) Takfiri group. Regardless, don t think for one second that the Pentagon doesn t already have some boots on the ground inside Syria  DELTA FORCE: According to a report at Friends of Syria, US Delta Force units are already on the ground in southern Syria near Jordanian border (Image Source: South Front)RTSecretary of Defense Ash Carter has reiterated US plans to increase its military presence in the campaign to retake Mosul and Raqqa from Islamic State, but urged other members of its coalition   like Turkey   to contribute more to the war effort. We re looking for opportunities to do more, and there will be boots on the ground   I want to be clear about that   but it s a strategic question, whether you are enabling local forces to take and hold, rather than trying to substitute for them,  Carter told CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. I don t think we or anybody else can substitute for them, but there s a lot we can do to enable them, including being on the ground with them. US to increase number of troops in Iraq; Carter discusses 'accelerating' ISIS campaign https://t.co/cub1ZQ50Vi pic.twitter.com/FZBqbeBk3M  RT (@RT_com) January 21, 2016There are currently about 3,600 US military staff in Iraq, in training and military support roles, with US officials announcing earlier this week that  hundreds, not thousands  more will be on their way shortly, though Carter himself vowed on Thursday that the numbers would  increase greatly as the momentum of the effort increases. The reason for the uptick is the planned offensive against Raqqa, Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) headquarters in Syria, and Mosul, Iraq s second biggest city also overrun by IS Continue this story at RT READ MORE PENTAGON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Pentagon Files\",\n          \"They say karma s a bi*ch, and it continues to be for the Republicans. First, it was Rubio who was dragged off to court by the birthers who claim that he s not eligible to be president. Now, birthers have gone after Ted Cruz in Texas.A Texas attorney has filed suit in federal district court saying that Cruz can t be president because he s not a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Cruz was born in Canada. One of the few requirements to become president in the U.S. Constitution is to be a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Attorney Newton B. Schwartz, Sr.. in a 28 page complaint, is demanding that the U.S. Supreme Court address the issue since  natural born  has never been defined. Schwartz said:  This 229-year question has never been pled, presented to or finally decided by or resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. Only the U.S. Supreme Court can finally decide, determine judicially and settle this issue now. Cruz, who ironically is an anti-immigration hawk, believes there is no issue. During Thursday s debate, Cruz went on the defensive against Trump, who s been at the forefront of questioning Cruz s eligibility. Cruz said:  There s nothing to this birther issue. Since September, the Constitution hasn t changed. But the poll numbers have. I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law are really clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen abroad is a natural born citizen. Not so simple says respected constitutional lawyer Mary Brigid McManamon at Widener University s Delaware Law School: The Constitution provides that  No person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President.  The concept of  natural born  comes from common law, and it is that law the Supreme Court has said we must turn to for the concept s definition. On this subject, common law is clear and unambiguous. The 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone, the preeminent authority on it, declared natural-born citizens are  such as are born within the dominions of the crown of England  while aliens are  such as are born out of it.  The key to this division is the assumption of allegiance to one s country of birth. The Americans who drafted the Constitution adopted this principle for the United States. James Madison, known as the  father of the Constitution,  stated,  It is an established maxim that birth is a criterion of allegiance. . . . [And] place is the most certain criterion; it is what applies in the United States.' Based on this interpretation, Cruz is disqualified. The irony in all this is that Cruz supports denying citizenship to children born in the United States, but whose parents are not US citizens.Is it karma that the Republicans are now reeling from the prospect of two of their leading candidates being ineligible for the presidency?  Throughout President Obama s seven years in the White House, many Republicans have floated the idea that he was not born in the United States. In fact, they propagated the idea so much that 53% of Republicans believe this nonsense today.The birther movement, which consists of many Republicans, has attacked and tried to discredit the president for years. Now, that same movement is after the very same institution, the Republican Party, that propagated it in the first place.Featured image via Nation of Change\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

On Dec. 7, the week after a Muslim couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, the Republican called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” Speaking as he presented the State Department annual report on religious freedom, David Saperstein, the U.S. ambassador at large for that issue, was asked whether the comments made his job of promoting religious tolerance in foreign nations harder. “Countries across the globe ... they see clearly the basic constitutional, institutional constraints against violations of religious freedom in the United States, and I think see clearly and believe deeply in America’s promise to be a model about treating all people equally without regard to religion,” Saperstein said. “That is clear and that is not tarnished by the statements here,” he added. “No matter who is elected, the institutions and the United States’ constitutional constraints will ensure that we continue along the line we have for the last 200 years.” At the time, Trump’s comments were condemned by the White House, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and some of the candidates then vying with Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. More recently, the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq took Trump to task at the Democratic National Convention over his rhetoric on Muslims, prompting a spat that triggered renewed criticism of the Republican candidate. Democratic presidential nominee Clinton’s lead over Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election increased to more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from less than 3 points on Thursday.    \n",

failing  mainstream media and the  failing  Democrat party blaming  fake news conservative news for Hillary s loss. To say Facebook favoritism got Donald Trump elected is the most ridiculous thing I ve heard yet. We already know Facebook is in the business of censoring and de-prioritizing conservative leading posts.    \n",

So naturally, impeachment is being floated around. The former reality show star and co-writer of  Art of the Deal , has unsurprisingly failed to make any deals after being on the job for 8 months now. Trump s approval ratings are abysmal as he finds himself to be the most unpopular president ever in the 70-year history of polling and then there are the investigations into his presidential campaign s possible ties to Russia.On top of that, White House advisers have reportedly been warning Trump about his potential removal from office, which entails the exhaustive impeachment process, according to Newsweek.Meanwhile, Trump is so worried that he s taken to his Twitter account to look for protection. It s very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President,  Trump tweeted in late July.  If Republicans don t Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand! According to The Washington Post, several White House advisers have voiced their concerns to Trump about his possible impeachment, and about how overcoming such proceedings would require friendships with the elected officials responsible for making a decision as to whether he should remain in office, but instead, he seems to be at battle with them, including his Republican colleagues, who he has lashed out at repeatedly. If Democrats take the House in 2018, impeachment proceedings could begin. And as far as funding his ego-wall along the Southern border, well, that wouldn t even be a consideration in a Democratic controlled House.Trump s latest war has been with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a man of influence in Washington, DC. Despite what we might think of McConnell, he s a powerful man. He could, ironically, make Trump a one-term President. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images   \n",

The documents were seized in a raid after U.S. SEAL Rob O Neill killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand-picked just a few of the 470,000 documents to release. They hid damning evidence that could have hurt Obama s chance at reelection in 2012 .OBAMA RAN THE CLOCK OUT AL QAEDA WAS NOT  ON THE RUN :Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard:  In a manner of speaking, Barack Obama wanted what al Qaeda already had: a mutually beneficial partnership with Tehran. Revealing to the American people the truth about Osama bin Laden s cozy working relationship with the Iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest, just as the ongoing vitality of al Qaeda, amply testified to in the bin Laden documents, would have contradicted Obama s proud claims in 2012 that al Qaeda was  on the run.  So Obama, with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community, bottled up the bin Laden documents and ran out the clock.IRAN S CLOSE TIES TO AL QAEDA COULD HURT THE IRAN DEAL:Within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al Qaeda   Tehran ties: how Iran supplied  everything needed,  including  money, arms  and  training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon,  including safe haven for other jihadis, the New York Post reported.The assessment is raising questions as to how much then-President Obama knew about Iran s ties to al Qaeda before making his controversial deal. And it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key.The Obama White House had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons. Bin Laden had called Iran a  main artery for funds, personnel and communication  for al Qaeda, the Post reported.That wasn t the only suspicious dealing Obama had with Iran. In August 2016, Republicans were furious over a reported deal Obama had made to release American hostages in Iran.The former administration denied paying $400 million in  ransom  for the hostages, arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long-standing case. However, it was only the first of three payments to the Iranians totaling $1.3 billion that took place after the hostage release, as the Wall Street Journal disclosed. And strikingly, much of the case came by way of plane-loads of cash in international currencies.But the revelations about bin Laden and the former administration don t end there.MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO BIN LADEN:In one of the 10,000 videos files contained within the newly released documents, bin Laden is asked to name is his influences. The terrorist leader didn t hesitate, The National reported. From a religious aspect, I was committed within the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden also suggested the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi. It was the first time I travelled to a country where I did not know the language,  he writes.  I carried a pistol and went. The Brotherhood, they had poor knowledge about things. If they knew, I would not have had to travel through Syria to Antakya 12 hours by bus to reach Istanbul. It was easier from Jeddah to Istanbul by plane. Three hours by plane. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO CLINTONS:Critics of the Muslim Brotherhood have long warned of its terror affiliation and infiltration into the West. One Brotherhood official Gehad el-Haddad was arrested two years ago in Cairo for inciting violence. El-Haddad (pictured below) previously worked as an executive for the Clinton Foundation.

              "67965  What the heck is going on over at FOX News, the cable news network that used to be the only place on TV that Americans could go to for truth?Sean Hannity is one of the few conservative voices with a massive audience who is willing to stick his neck out and risk his career to get the truth out behind the murder of 27-year old DNC staffer Seth Rich.After the notorious hacker Kim Dot.com tweeted about his claim to have evidence that Seth Rich was the person who sent the DNC emails to Wikileaks, Sean Hannity responded to him. Hannity even asked Dotcom to appear on his show, hoping that he would reveal evidence that Seth Rich was the person who sent the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and NOT the Russians.Here was the first email from Kim Dotcom where he claims to have known Seth Rich and that Rich was the Wikileaks source.  Dotcom also claims he was involved in the email exchange.I knew Seth Rich. I know he was the @Wikileaks source. I was involved. https://t.co/MbGQteHhZM  Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) May 20, 2017Sean Hannity responded to Kim Dotcom s tweet:You are the evidence? Can you explain that in more detail? https://t.co/9oOP3mYOn9  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 20, 2017Hannity then invited Kim Dotcom to appear on his show and share the evidence he has that Rich was the DNC leaker with his audience:Stay tuned. Public invitation Kim Dotcom to be a guest on radio and TV. #GameChanger Buckle up destroy Trump media. Sheep that u all are!!! https://t.co/3qLwXCGl6z  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 20, 2017Kim Dotcom applauded Hannity for pursuing the Rich case:Congress, investigate Seth Rich Murder! @JulianAssange made comments u need to listen to! If Seth was wiki source, no Trump/Russia collusion https://t.co/QPHZwypU34  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 22, 2017The flailing cable network station FOX News, that just fell into 3rd place in the ratings after firing their top host Bill O Reilly, made a public statement today about Sean Hannity s investigation into the murder of Seth Rich and the possibility that he was the DNC leaker.From FOX News:On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.After FOX News disavowed the Seth Rich story, liberal rag  The Daily Beast  published a story with unnamed sources at FOX News who were  embarrassed  by Sean Hannity pursuing this story, claiming he had  no evidence .Sean Hannity re-tweeted their baseless, nameless story here:Very interesting. My heart is not troubled in the least. Night all. https://t.co/MgOow2XVYu  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017It s interesting how leftist publications are circling conservative media like a bunch of vultures trying to shut down anyone who questions the Seth Rich   DNC emails connection to Wikileaks, calling it  embarrassing  because there is  no evidence , yet they ve been carrying on with an investigation into Trump-Russia collusion during the election that has not yielded an ounce of evidence. But that s somehow not  embarrassing?  Sorry hypocrites, you can t have it both ways Haha Shocking. \"Anonymous sources\" again!! Name names!!Maybe these anonymous people can work at @CNN and help with Fake News. Or I can .. https://t.co/1PCHjEjnC7  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017Hannity also tweeted about the media hypocrisy here:And if you dare ASK AN HONEST QUESTION, now it's a \"conspiracy theory with, NO PROOF\". Greatest hypocrisy ever. STAY TUNED! Busy week. https://t.co/Or7zCqZOFl  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017Sean Hannity to his credit, has stayed the course and is sticking his neck out to get the truth out about Seth Rich. Only a few hours ago, Hannity tweeted about his bombshell announcement about Seth Rich tonight, and curiously, he also tweeted about his  future at FOX!  Who s pulling the strings at FOX these days? Huge announcement tonight about Seth Rich, Trump/Russian Collusion corrupt media, the liberal effort to silence me. And my future at Fox!  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017Did George Soros get to the liberal Murdoch brothers? It would appear that Hannity may be suggesting they are in this tweet:I said publicly over and over to the Rich Family they are in my thoughts and prayers. I m trying to find the truth as the Mom Dad bro asked https://t.co/op11hVRlWW  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017The more attention the Seth Rich case gets, the more the left is freaking out. Watch sanctimonious and as far as we know, the jobless Keith Olbermann (he lists his job as a  GQ correspondent  in his Twitter profile) tell his massive audience on Twitter (only 169 people  liked  his video) that Seth Rich was murdered in a  botched robbery .  Sorry Keith Bozo, but when nothing of value is stolen from the body of the person you were  robbing  it s not really considered a  robbery. NEW VIDEO: If you're one of the scum selling this Seth Rich story to deflect from this scum Trump: Burn In Hell pic.twitter.com/6Iut1RB8av  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) May 22, 2017The left will stop at nothing to keep this story out of the news and to keep the focus on a Trump-Russia narrative that to date, has not provided one shred of actual evidence to their claim.  Tonight could be a make it or break it night for Sean Hannity and his career with FOX News. No matter what happens on Hannity s show tonight, he s a hero in our eyes for at least pursuing the possibility that something other than the contrived Trump-Russia narrative put forth by the Democrats and their allies in the media could actually be the truth Here s to Hannity making conservatives proud again!    \n",

The White House has announced that 35 intelligence operatives are being ejected from the country. In addition, sanctions will be placed on Russia s two leading intelligence services, including four top officers of the military intelligence unit.On Thursday, Obama signed an executive order which grants the president the authority to impose travel bans and asset freezes on those who  tamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information, with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions. The New York Times reports:Mr. Obama used that order to immediately impose sanctions on four Russian intelligence officials: Igor Valentinovich Korobov, the current chief of a military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., and three deputies: Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, the deputy chief of the G.R.U.; Igor Olegovich Kostyukov, a first deputy chief, and Vladimir Stepanovich Alekseyev, also a first deputy chief of the G.R.U The administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations: the Special Technologies Center, a signals intelligence operation in St. Petersburg; a firm called Zor Security that is also known as Esage Lab; and the Autonomous Non-commercial Organization Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems, whose lengthy name, American officials said, was cover for a group that provided special training for the hacking.It is unclear at the moment how much of an impact these measures will actually have. The move may end up being largely symbolic, but as the Times points out,  the actions would amount to the strongest American response ever taken to a state-sponsored cyberattack aimed at the United States. U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security, all agree that Russia was behind the DNC hacks and the subsequent slow release of damaging information obtained in those hacks during the presidential campaign. They have also concluded that Russia interfered with the election for one reason: to help Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.Trump has blown off the findings of the U.S. intelligence community as  ridiculous.  Because the punishments Obama imposed today are an executive order, Trump will have the option of nixing the sanctions when he takes office next month. If he chooses to do so, it is likely that members of Congress, including Republicans, will be furious as they have been calling for an official investigation into the matter.The White House is also planning to release a joint analytic report  from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security which will give more insight into the information that has been gathered by the National Security Agency. The report is expected to be published before Obama leaves office in three weeks.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images   \n",

Reid’s letter, dated Saturday, was first obtained by The New York Times and shared on its website on Monday. It was followed on Tuesday by a letter from four Democrats asking Comey to assess whether campaign officials working for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be colluding with Russian interests to carry out recent hacks against the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in order to “interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” That letter was signed by Representatives Elijah Cummings, John Conyers, Elliot Engel and Bennie Thompson, each of whom serves as the top Democrat on a different congressional committee. Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Comey, speaking at a cyber security conference on Tuesday, declined to give details about what the Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing in connection with the political hacking but indicated the agency was closely watching what foreign countries are doing. “We take very seriously any effort by any actor, ... especially nation states, that moves beyond the collection of information ... and offers the prospect of an effort to influence the conduct of affairs in our country, whether that is an election or something else,” he said. The two letters follow a spate of hacking attacks targeting U.S. political databases, including some that officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that. The FBI examined breaches in voter registration databases in Illinois and Arizona but did not specify who might have been behind it. Reid said that the threat of Russian government tampering in the election was “more extensive than widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results.” He also voiced concerns about possible Russian government efforts to manipulate Trump’s campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election, and to use it as a vehicle to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin.    \n",

The facility was inundated with so much water that it lost power, and that s when the chemical reactions began. When stored at improper temperatures, the organic peroxides at Arkema are unstable, leading to  popping  sounds, smoke, and eventually fire.Those fires emitted a smoke that many in the area described differently. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the emissions were like standing over a barbecue pit or something like that, where you get smoke in your eyes,  according to NBC News. Richard Rennard, a representative of Arkema, described what came from the plant a little more cautiously:[The emissions are] noxious, certainly. I don t know the composition of the smoke.A deputy was, in fact, taken to the hospital after inhaling the fumes coming from the plant.But after officials warned everyone in a nearly two-mile radius that more explosions could follow, questions about whether the plant was following proper safety protocols began to arise. That s when Arkema s connection to the Trump EPA came to light.The International Business Times got their hands on federal records that showed Arkema successfully lobbied EPA Chief Scott Pruitt and a number of Republicans in an effort to delay new safety regulations for chemical plants that were passed by the Obama administration. Those rules, crafted after the chemical plant disaster in West, Texas 200 miles from Houston, would have taken effect in March. They also would have directly affected Arkema.In their letter opposing the new regulations, Arkema used standard conservative trope: That the rules would  likely add significant new costs and burdens to the corporate audit process.  Those costs, of course, would be on top of the more than $90,000 in OSHA fines assessed to the Crosby Arkema plant this year alone, all for  serious  violations. But it was nonetheless Arkema s conclusion that  the final rule includes a litany of costly changes that have not been shown to increase safety. That seems a little less than true at this point.Although Texas Governor Greg Abbott has blocked public access to state records of just what chemicals are stored in which facilities, the AP reported that the Arkema plant also housed sulfur dioxide and methylpropen, which are, respectively, toxic and flammable. Storage of these chemicals would have required Arkema to file a risk management plan with the EPA   which would have triggered the new Obama-era rules.If Trump hadn t struck them down, that is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images   \n",

If you have heard of the Duggar family you ve likely heard of the Quiverfull movement they belong to, which requires Christians to have as many kids as possible, which is why the Duggars have 19 children.But there is another part of the Quiverfull movement that is even creepier.One Quiverfull ministry not only pushes couples to pop out kids like rabbits, they preach that fathers should farm the girls like crops such as apples and give them over to men as early as possible .In other words, this Christian fundamentalist movement believe in child marriage like the ones Americans often are horrified by when we hear stories of little girls being married off to middle-aged men in the Middle East.Their website is called  Let Them Marry,  and one of the first things you would see is a tree shaped missive comparing little girls to apples that must be picked early by the farmer/father and provided to men who are  in need. Girls are like apples on trees. Their fathers are the farmers, whose job is to care for them. He must protect his apples from pests and disease. He must guard them against thieves who may pick his apples prematurely. Neither those at the top nor those at the bottom can help their location. But, when each reaches peak ripeness, it is the farmer s job to harvest that fruit and give it to whom he will, to those in need. So there is nothing wrong with the apples still on the tree and nothing wrong with the boys who seek them. But it is the farmer s duty to provide for both, in due season. Here s the image via Raw Story.A quote from the group leader, Vaughn Ohlman, makes it clear that this pedophilia comes not from the legalization of same-sex marriage like conservatives constantly claim, but directly from religious fanaticism, which former Quiverfull member Vyckie Garrison describes as a  gross  ideology combined with the Christian purity movement in which  the value of a young woman is in her virginity   a consumable commodity owned by her future husband, kept in trust by Daddy. We believe that not only should most people marry, they should marry in their youth. The Bible speaks of the  wife of thy youth  (Prov. 5:18; Is. 54:6; Mal. 2:14-15) and  children of the youth  (Ps. 127:4). Scripture also speaks of not letting children pass the flower of their age (1 Cor. 7:36)   Leaving the physically mature young man struggling with fornication and leaving the physically mature young woman wallowing in fruitless, barren celibacy these are both unscriptural and ungodly actions.In short, this conservative Christian group is a haven for pedophiles who are trying to use religious liberty to justify their sickening desire to marry and rape little girls.Just another example of the Christian Sharia law conservatives are trying to force down our throats.

              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States does not tarnish the U.S. commitment to religious freedom in the eyes of foreigners, a State Department official said on Wednesday. On Dec. 7, the week after a Muslim couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, the Republican called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” Speaking as he presented the State Department annual report on religious freedom, David Saperstein, the U.S. ambassador at large for that issue, was asked whether the comments made his job of promoting religious tolerance in foreign nations harder. “Countries across the globe ... they see clearly the basic constitutional, institutional constraints against violations of religious freedom in the United States, and I think see clearly and believe deeply in America’s promise to be a model about treating all people equally without regard to religion,” Saperstein said. “That is clear and that is not tarnished by the statements here,” he added. “No matter who is elected, the institutions and the United States’ constitutional constraints will ensure that we continue along the line we have for the last 200 years.” At the time, Trump’s comments were condemned by the White House, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and some of the candidates then vying with Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. More recently, the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq took Trump to task at the Democratic National Convention over his rhetoric on Muslims, prompting a spat that triggered renewed criticism of the Republican candidate. Democratic presidential nominee Clinton’s lead over Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election increased to more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from less than 3 points on Thursday.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Donald Trump s so-called presidency is plagued with so many scandals it s hard to keep up. So naturally, impeachment is being floated around. The former reality show star and co-writer of  Art of the Deal , has unsurprisingly failed to make any deals after being on the job for 8 months now. Trump s approval ratings are abysmal as he finds himself to be the most unpopular president ever in the 70-year history of polling and then there are the investigations into his presidential campaign s possible ties to Russia.On top of that, White House advisers have reportedly been warning Trump about his potential removal from office, which entails the exhaustive impeachment process, according to Newsweek.Meanwhile, Trump is so worried that he s taken to his Twitter account to look for protection. It s very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President,  Trump tweeted in late July.  If Republicans don t Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand! According to The Washington Post, several White House advisers have voiced their concerns to Trump about his possible impeachment, and about how overcoming such proceedings would require friendships with the elected officials responsible for making a decision as to whether he should remain in office, but instead, he seems to be at battle with them, including his Republican colleagues, who he has lashed out at repeatedly. If Democrats take the House in 2018, impeachment proceedings could begin. And as far as funding his ego-wall along the Southern border, well, that wouldn t even be a consideration in a Democratic controlled House.Trump s latest war has been with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a man of influence in Washington, DC. Despite what we might think of McConnell, he s a powerful man. He could, ironically, make Trump a one-term President. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images</td>\n",

              "      <td>The Obama administration s well guarded Osama bin Laden documents were released on Wednesday by CIA director Mike Pompeo. The documents were seized in a raid after U.S. SEAL Rob O Neill killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand-picked just a few of the 470,000 documents to release. They hid damning evidence that could have hurt Obama s chance at reelection in 2012 .OBAMA RAN THE CLOCK OUT AL QAEDA WAS NOT  ON THE RUN :Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard:  In a manner of speaking, Barack Obama wanted what al Qaeda already had: a mutually beneficial partnership with Tehran. Revealing to the American people the truth about Osama bin Laden s cozy working relationship with the Iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest, just as the ongoing vitality of al Qaeda, amply testified to in the bin Laden documents, would have contradicted Obama s proud claims in 2012 that al Qaeda was  on the run.  So Obama, with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community, bottled up the bin Laden documents and ran out the clock.IRAN S CLOSE TIES TO AL QAEDA COULD HURT THE IRAN DEAL:Within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al Qaeda   Tehran ties: how Iran supplied  everything needed,  including  money, arms  and  training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon,  including safe haven for other jihadis, the New York Post reported.The assessment is raising questions as to how much then-President Obama knew about Iran s ties to al Qaeda before making his controversial deal. And it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key.The Obama White House had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons. Bin Laden had called Iran a  main artery for funds, personnel and communication  for al Qaeda, the Post reported.That wasn t the only suspicious dealing Obama had with Iran. In August 2016, Republicans were furious over a reported deal Obama had made to release American hostages in Iran.The former administration denied paying $400 million in  ransom  for the hostages, arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long-standing case. However, it was only the first of three payments to the Iranians totaling $1.3 billion that took place after the hostage release, as the Wall Street Journal disclosed. And strikingly, much of the case came by way of plane-loads of cash in international currencies.But the revelations about bin Laden and the former administration don t end there.MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO BIN LADEN:In one of the 10,000 videos files contained within the newly released documents, bin Laden is asked to name is his influences. The terrorist leader didn t hesitate, The National reported. From a religious aspect, I was committed within the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden also suggested the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi. It was the first time I travelled to a country where I did not know the language,  he writes.  I carried a pistol and went. The Brotherhood, they had poor knowledge about things. If they knew, I would not have had to travel through Syria to Antakya 12 hours by bus to reach Istanbul. It was easier from Jeddah to Istanbul by plane. Three hours by plane. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO CLINTONS:Critics of the Muslim Brotherhood have long warned of its terror affiliation and infiltration into the West. One Brotherhood official Gehad el-Haddad was arrested two years ago in Cairo for inciting violence. El-Haddad (pictured below) previously worked as an executive for the Clinton Foundation.

Hannity even asked Dotcom to appear on his show, hoping that he would reveal evidence that Seth Rich was the person who sent the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and NOT the Russians.Here was the first email from Kim Dotcom where he claims to have known Seth Rich and that Rich was the Wikileaks source.

The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.After FOX News disavowed the Seth Rich story, liberal rag  The Daily Beast  published a story with unnamed sources at FOX News who were  embarrassed  by Sean Hannity pursuing this story, claiming he had  no evidence .Sean Hannity re-tweeted their baseless, nameless story here:Very interesting.

But that s somehow not  embarrassing?  Sorry hypocrites, you can t have it both ways Haha Shocking. \"Anonymous sources\" again!!

Tonight could be a make it or break it night for Sean Hannity and his career with FOX News.

              "      <td>The Obama Administration is finally taking action after Russia interfered in the presidential election. The White House has announced that 35 intelligence operatives are being ejected from the country. In addition, sanctions will be placed on Russia s two leading intelligence services, including four top officers of the military intelligence unit.On Thursday, Obama signed an executive order which grants the president the authority to impose travel bans and asset freezes on those who  tamper with, alter, or cause a misappropriation of information, with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions. The New York Times reports:Mr. Obama used that order to immediately impose sanctions on four Russian intelligence officials: Igor Valentinovich Korobov, the current chief of a military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., and three deputies: Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, the deputy chief of the G.R.U.; Igor Olegovich Kostyukov, a first deputy chief, and Vladimir Stepanovich Alekseyev, also a first deputy chief of the G.R.U The administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations: the Special Technologies Center, a signals intelligence operation in St. Petersburg; a firm called Zor Security that is also known as Esage Lab; and the Autonomous Non-commercial Organization Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems, whose lengthy name, American officials said, was cover for a group that provided special training for the hacking.It is unclear at the moment how much of an impact these measures will actually have. The move may end up being largely symbolic, but as the Times points out,  the actions would amount to the strongest American response ever taken to a state-sponsored cyberattack aimed at the United States. U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security, all agree that Russia was behind the DNC hacks and the subsequent slow release of damaging information obtained in those hacks during the presidential campaign. They have also concluded that Russia interfered with the election for one reason: to help Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.Trump has blown off the findings of the U.S. intelligence community as  ridiculous.  Because the punishments Obama imposed today are an executive order, Trump will have the option of nixing the sanctions when he takes office next month. If he chooses to do so, it is likely that members of Congress, including Republicans, will be furious as they have been calling for an official investigation into the matter.The White House is also planning to release a joint analytic report  from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security which will give more insight into the information that has been gathered by the National Security Agency. The report is expected to be published before Obama leaves office in three weeks.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</td>\n",

              "      <td>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress, including party Senate leader Harry Reid, asked the FBI to investigate concerns that the Russian government may be attempting to undermine the U.S. presidential election through cyber attacks that could include tampering with voting results. “The prospect of a hostile government actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the Cold War,” Reid said in a letter to FBI Director James Comey. Reid’s letter, dated Saturday, was first obtained by The New York Times and shared on its website on Monday. It was followed on Tuesday by a letter from four Democrats asking Comey to assess whether campaign officials working for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be colluding with Russian interests to carry out recent hacks against the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in order to “interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” That letter was signed by Representatives Elijah Cummings, John Conyers, Elliot Engel and Bennie Thompson, each of whom serves as the top Democrat on a different congressional committee. Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Comey, speaking at a cyber security conference on Tuesday, declined to give details about what the Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing in connection with the political hacking but indicated the agency was closely watching what foreign countries are doing. “We take very seriously any effort by any actor, ... especially nation states, that moves beyond the collection of information ... and offers the prospect of an effort to influence the conduct of affairs in our country, whether that is an election or something else,” he said. The two letters follow a spate of hacking attacks targeting U.S. political databases, including some that officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that. The FBI examined breaches in voter registration databases in Illinois and Arizona but did not specify who might have been behind it. Reid said that the threat of Russian government tampering in the election was “more extensive than widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results.” He also voiced concerns about possible Russian government efforts to manipulate Trump’s campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election, and to use it as a vehicle to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</td>\n",

              "      <td>In the aftermath of the historic flooding that accompanied Hurricane Harvey s high winds and torrential rains, there was a surprising effect on the Arkema chemical plant east of Houston on Greens Bayou. The facility was inundated with so much water that it lost power, and that s when the chemical reactions began. When stored at improper temperatures, the organic peroxides at Arkema are unstable, leading to  popping  sounds, smoke, and eventually fire.Those fires emitted a smoke that many in the area described differently. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the emissions were like standing over a barbecue pit or something like that, where you get smoke in your eyes,  according to NBC News. Richard Rennard, a representative of Arkema, described what came from the plant a little more cautiously:[The emissions are] noxious, certainly. I don t know the composition of the smoke.A deputy was, in fact, taken to the hospital after inhaling the fumes coming from the plant.But after officials warned everyone in a nearly two-mile radius that more explosions could follow, questions about whether the plant was following proper safety protocols began to arise. That s when Arkema s connection to the Trump EPA came to light.The International Business Times got their hands on federal records that showed Arkema successfully lobbied EPA Chief Scott Pruitt and a number of Republicans in an effort to delay new safety regulations for chemical plants that were passed by the Obama administration. Those rules, crafted after the chemical plant disaster in West, Texas 200 miles from Houston, would have taken effect in March. They also would have directly affected Arkema.In their letter opposing the new regulations, Arkema used standard conservative trope: That the rules would  likely add significant new costs and burdens to the corporate audit process.  Those costs, of course, would be on top of the more than $90,000 in OSHA fines assessed to the Crosby Arkema plant this year alone, all for  serious  violations. But it was nonetheless Arkema s conclusion that  the final rule includes a litany of costly changes that have not been shown to increase safety. That seems a little less than true at this point.Although Texas Governor Greg Abbott has blocked public access to state records of just what chemicals are stored in which facilities, the AP reported that the Arkema plant also housed sulfur dioxide and methylpropen, which are, respectively, toxic and flammable. Storage of these chemicals would have required Arkema to file a risk management plan with the EPA   which would have triggered the new Obama-era rules.If Trump hadn t struck them down, that is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</td>\n",

              "      <td>Likening girls to common crops that should be rushed off to the market as soon as possible is a growing belief among conservative  Christians. If you have heard of the Duggar family you ve likely heard of the Quiverfull movement they belong to, which requires Christians to have as many kids as possible, which is why the Duggars have 19 children.But there is another part of the Quiverfull movement that is even creepier.One Quiverfull ministry not only pushes couples to pop out kids like rabbits, they preach that fathers should farm the girls like crops such as apples and give them over to men as early as possible .In other words, this Christian fundamentalist movement believe in child marriage like the ones Americans often are horrified by when we hear stories of little girls being married off to middle-aged men in the Middle East.Their website is called  Let Them Marry,  and one of the first things you would see is a tree shaped missive comparing little girls to apples that must be picked early by the farmer/father and provided to men who are  in need. Girls are like apples on trees. Their fathers are the farmers, whose job is to care for them. He must protect his apples from pests and disease. He must guard them against thieves who may pick his apples prematurely. Neither those at the top nor those at the bottom can help their location. But, when each reaches peak ripeness, it is the farmer s job to harvest that fruit and give it to whom he will, to those in need. So there is nothing wrong with the apples still on the tree and nothing wrong with the boys who seek them. But it is the farmer s duty to provide for both, in due season. Here s the image via Raw Story.A quote from the group leader, Vaughn Ohlman, makes it clear that this pedophilia comes not from the legalization of same-sex marriage like conservatives constantly claim, but directly from religious fanaticism, which former Quiverfull member Vyckie Garrison describes as a  gross  ideology combined with the Christian purity movement in which  the value of a young woman is in her virginity   a consumable commodity owned by her future husband, kept in trust by Daddy. We believe that not only should most people marry, they should marry in their youth. The Bible speaks of the  wife of thy youth  (Prov. 5:18; Is. 54:6; Mal. 2:14-15) and  children of the youth  (Ps. 127:4). Scripture also speaks of not letting children pass the flower of their age (1 Cor. 7:36)   Leaving the physically mature young man struggling with fornication and leaving the physically mature young woman wallowing in fruitless, barren celibacy these are both unscriptural and ungodly actions.In short, this conservative Christian group is a haven for pedophiles who are trying to use religious liberty to justify their sickening desire to marry and rape little girls.Just another example of the Christian Sharia law conservatives are trying to force down our throats.

A soldier with an artificial arm hitches up his robe to reveal a stump where his leg once was. He is angry that authorities have done little to help him since he was wounded.   I was at the front and a mortar exploded near me. We fought well, but now I get no salary, no support from the government or anyone. They just left us,  said Hassan Meigan. More than two years into a war that has already left 10,000 dead, regional power Saudi Arabia is struggling to pull together an effective local military force to defeat the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that has seized large parts of Yemen. The dysfunction is a reminder to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that his campaign to counter arch-enemy Iran in the Middle East, including threats against Tehran s ally Hezbollah, may be hard to implement. During a rare visit to a large area of Yemeni territory controlled by the pro-Saudi government, journalists saw a patchwork of mutually suspicious army units, whose loyalty to disparate regions and commanders has hindered their war against Houthi fighters. Some soldiers appeared to be hunkering down in their bases rather than joining the fight. Those who do fight say salaries go unpaid for months. The front lines have barely moved for months. Saudi Arabia has sought to create a unified military force based in Marib, but these troops have failed to eject the Houthis from the nearby capital Sanaa, where the Saudis see the rebels as a threat to their national security. With Saudi politics in turmoil after a wave of high-profile arrests and Iranian influence growing, Yemeni officers recognize the importance of an effective army but acknowledge that success still eludes them.  Empowering the National Army and unifying all weapons and authority under it is our goal. This is what we re trying to accomplish so we can end the war with a military victory,  Brigadier General Marzooq al-Seyadi, a top Yemeni commander, told Reuters.  The difficulties until now in achieving this in the face of local and ideological factors have posed problems ... but with the aid of the Arab Coalition and the United States, which provides daily advice and support to our side, we will succeed.  A coalition spokesman, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said in September that the mission was to back Yemen  whether it s inside the country by supporting the Yemeni National Army or defending the borders and territory of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Sunni Saudi Arabia has led the mostly Gulf Arab coalition against the Shi ite Houthis, since they seized the Yemeni capital and fanned out across the country. But the Houthis  rump state in Yemen s Western highlands has weathered thousands of Saudi-led air strikes that have been aided by refueling and intelligence from the United States. Denying they are a pawn of Iran, the Houthis say they are fighting to fend off a mercenary army in the thrall of the Gulf and the West. The group launched a missile toward Riyadh s main airport on Saturday, which Saudi Arabia said was a declaration of war by Tehran. But after years of fighting that have ravaged the deeply poor country with hunger and disease, even some of Saudi Arabia s staunchest allies in Yemen say they are angry at being manipulated from abroad.  We re fighting as proxies ... (Western powers) can end the war in Yemen. They can pressure Iran and Saudi Arabia, solve their issues and their differences,  said Ali Abd-Rabbu al-Qadhi, a lawmaker and tribal leader from Marib.  It s Yemeni blood that s being shed ... We re one society with common roots and one religion, but the international conflict has brought us to where we are,  said al-Qadhi, who wore a holstered pistol over his traditional Yemeni sarong. Despite the lack of progress on the battlefield, some soldiers on the dusty streets of Marib appeared eager to fight.  Onward to Sanaa, God willing!  smiled Abdullah al-Sufi, 20, whose khaki fatigues hung loose on his gangly frame.  We know there are foreign conspiracies on Yemeni soil, there are problems, there are setbacks. But we are fighting for our country and for our homes, that s the important thing.  As war started in March 2015, after Saudi Prince Mohammed sent in troops, Yemen s most powerful units had already sided with Houthi militiamen to rain rockets and tank fire on Marib, which the fledgling new army and allied tribes repelled. In the most ambitious military adventure in their history, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates took part in that fight, but were stung by scores of combat deaths. The Arab forces have largely pulled back to a support role in bases far from the front line. Now units trained by Saudi Arabia fight in scattered theaters with little obvious coordination, loyal to different parties and local leaders in a society awash with guns and notorious for its fickle politics. The kingdom supports brigades adhering to Sunni Islam s puritanical Salafi school in Western Yemen, while also backing the Muslim Brotherhood around Marib and loyalists of exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the south. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates, - the other key Gulf power in the anti-Iran war effort in Yemen - has armed and trained formidable units across southern and eastern Yemen. To add to the confusion, these fighters despise the Houthis as well as pro-Saudi units in northern Yemen.  Displayed on walls all over Marib, portraits of slain soldiers are captioned with poems praising them as  martyrs  and  lions.   My son is sixteen. He said  dad, give me a gun, I want to fight.  He goes to the front now. No father is happy with this, but what can we do? This is a war, this is the situation we re in,  said one Marib veteran. Yemen s government also appears to be living through difficult times. President Hadi has been in Riyadh since being ejected from his country by the Houthis, and sources said his hosts have banned him from traveling for over a month, citing poor security in Yemen. Officials in his office denied the reports. But the Saudi response this week to the Houthi ballistic missile - to close all ports, borders and airspace, the majority of which are nominally under Hadi s control - appeared to deal an unprecedented rebuke to their ally. Activist Khalid Baqlan expressed the fear of many young people and professionals that the errors of a weak government and foreign powers were hollowing out Yemeni society.   What we re seeing is not the building of real state institutions but the empowerment of groups with competing agendas who could fight in the future, benefiting no one,  said Baqlan, from the Saba Youth Council, a civil society group.  There has to be a political solution, it s the only way to save the country.

Johnson, who campaigned to leave the EU in last year s referendum, is one of Britain s highest-profile politicians and seen as a possible replacement for Prime Minister Theresa May. On Friday, he praised a speech by May in which she set out her plan for a roughly two-year transition period after Brexit.  But the Telegraph reported that Johnson had set out a new set of demands, reviving talk of a split among May s senior ministers which has the potential to destabilize her minority government.  Boris will be one of those Cabinet ministers pushing to make sure we don t have any new EU rules and regulations during the transition,  a cabinet source was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Johnson had fueled talk of a leadership challenge ahead of May s speech by publishing his own 4,000-word plan for Brexit which was seen as a criticism of May s more cautious approach.  May s transition plan, set out in the Italian city of Florence in a speech that sought to break an impasse in negotiations with the EU, underlined the importance of regulation to the future economic relationship with the bloc. She highlighted the fact that Britain and the EU start with identical regulatory standards and said she wanted  a practical approach to regulation that enables us to continue to work together in bringing shared prosperity to our peoples . She did not say whether she thought EU regulations passed during the transition period would be matched by Britain but said, on EU law, that British courts would be able to take European Courts of Justice rulings into account. May s Brexit minister David Davis said he did expect British and EU regulations to diverge over time after Brexit. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump planned a Saturday meeting with Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and fierce Trump critic, and may discuss whether he should be a candidate for secretary of state, a source familiar with the meeting said on Thursday. Trump already has a lengthy list of potential candidates for the post of top U.S. diplomat, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who met Trump on Thursday. Trump, a former reality TV star, has shown a flair for the dramatic in his deliberations over his Cabinet, saying only he knows who \\u201cthe finalists\\u201d are. Corker told CNN on Wednesday he was \\u201cin the mix\\u201d for the position but that Trump might pick someone who was closer to him during the presidential campaign. He met on Thursday in Washington with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trump\\u2019s expected meeting with Romney amounts to an olive branch of sorts to one of his sharpest critics. Romney, who in a speech in March called Trump \\u201ca phony, a fraud,\\u201d urged Republicans to vote for anyone but the New York real estate magnate while the party was picking its presidential nominee. Trump, in turn, used harsh rhetoric at times during his campaign to dismiss Romney as a failure who blew a chance in 2012 to defeat Democratic President Barack Obama, whom Trump felt was a weak opponent. The source told Reuters that a broad discussion was expected during the meeting and that discussion about the secretary of state position was possible. The source had said earlier his understanding was that the meeting would occur on Sunday. Asked about the meeting, Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested it was still being arranged. \\u201cWe\\u2019re working on it,\\u201d she said.  \\u201cI think it\\u2019s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney,\\u201d U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Trump\\u2019s closest confidants and a potential nominee for defense secretary, told reporters at Manhattan\\u2019s Trump Tower. Sessions sounded far from certain Romney would be offered a job. \\u201cThere are a lot of talented people that he (Trump) needs good relationships with. And I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things. But he will be one of those, I am sure, that\\u2019s reviewed. Donald Trump will make that decision,\\u201d Sessions said. When Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, opted out of running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, people close to him suggested that serving as secretary of state might be appealing to him if a Republican won the presidency. A steady stream of potential Trump administration hires made their way through the lobby of Trump Tower to meet with either Trump or officials close to him. All indicated a willingness to serve, such as Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. He is a potential treasury secretary in the Trump administration. \\u201cI stand ready to help the president in any capacity possible. I\\u2019ve got a great position in public policy today, if he wants to talk to me obviously, about serving somewhere else, we\\u2019ll look at serving somewhere else,\\u201d he told reporters. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"December 14, 2017 \",\n          \"November 6, 2016\",\n          \"Oct 5, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

so naturally impeachment is being floated around the former reality show star and cowriter of  art of the deal  has unsurprisingly failed to make any deals after being on the job for  months now trump s approval ratings are abysmal as he finds himself to be the most unpopular president ever in the  history of polling and then there are the investigations into his presidential campaign s possible ties to russiaon top of that white house advisers have reportedly been warning trump about his potential removal from office which entails the exhaustive impeachment process according to newsweekmeanwhile trump is so worried that he s taken to his twitter account to look for protection it s very sad that republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their president  trump tweeted in late july  if republicans don t repeal and replace the disastrous obamacare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand according to the washington post several white house advisers have voiced their concerns to trump about his possible impeachment and about how overcoming such proceedings would require friendships with the elected officials responsible for making a decision as to whether he should remain in office but instead he seems to be at battle with them including his republican colleagues who he has lashed out at repeatedly if democrats take the house in  impeachment proceedings could begin and as far as funding his egowall along the southern border well that wouldn t even be a consideration in a democratic controlled housetrump s latest war has been with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a man of influence in washington dc despite what we might think of mcconnell he s a powerful man he could

administration s well guarded osama bin laden documents were released on wednesday by cia director mike pompeo the documents were seized in a raid after us seal rob o neill killed osama bin laden the obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they handpicked just a few of the  documents to release they hid damning evidence that could have hurt obama s chance at reelection in  obama ran the clock out al qaeda was not  on the run steve hayes of the weekly standard  in a manner of speaking barack obama wanted what al qaeda already had a mutually beneficial partnership with tehran revealing to the american people the truth about osama bin laden s cozy working relationship with the iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest just as the ongoing vitality of al qaeda amply testified to in the bin laden documents would have contradicted obama s proud claims in  that al qaeda was  on the run  so obama with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community bottled up the bin laden documents and ran out the clockiran s close ties to al qaeda could hurt the iran dealwithin the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al qaeda   tehran ties how iran supplied  everything needed  including  money arms  and  training in hezbollah camps in lebanon  including safe haven for other jihadis the new york post reportedthe assessment is raising questions as to how much thenpresident obama knew about iran s ties to al qaeda before making his controversial deal and it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and keythe obama white house had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons bin laden had called iran a  main artery for funds personnel and communication  for al qaeda the post reportedthat wasn t the only suspicious dealing obama had with iran in august  republicans were furious over a reported deal obama had made to release american hostages in iranthe former administration denied paying  million in  ransom  for the hostages arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a longstanding case however it was only the first of three payments to the iranians totaling  billion that took place after the hostage release as the wall street journal disclosed and strikingly much of the case came by way of planeloads of cash in international currenciesbut the revelations about bin laden and the former administration don t end theremuslim brotherhood connections to bin ladenin one of the  videos files contained within the newly released documents bin laden is asked to name is his influences the

conservative voices with a massive audience who is willing to stick his neck out and risk his career to get the truth out behind the murder of  old dnc staffer seth richafter the notorious hacker kim dotcom tweeted about his claim to have evidence that seth rich was the person who sent the dnc emails to wikileaks sean hannity responded to him hannity even asked dotcom to appear on his show hoping that he would reveal evidence that seth rich was the person who sent the dnc emails to wikileaks and not the russianshere was the first email from kim dotcom where he claims to have known seth rich and that rich was the wikileaks source  dotcom also claims he was involved in the email exchangei knew seth rich i know he was the wikileaks source i was involved   kim dotcom kimdotcom may   hannity

about sean hannity s investigation into the murder of seth rich and the possibility that he was the dnc leakerfrom fox newson may  a story was posted on the fox news website on the investigation into the  murder of dnc staffer seth rich the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting upon appropriate review the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removedwe will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warrantedafter fox news disavowed the seth rich story liberal rag  the daily beast  published a story with unnamed sources at fox news who were  embarrassed  by sean hannity pursuing this story claiming he had  no evidence sean hannity retweeted their baseless nameless story herevery interesting my heart is not troubled in the least night all   sean hannity seanhannity may   s interesting how leftist publications are circling conservative media like a bunch of vultures trying to shut down anyone who questions the seth rich   dnc emails connection to wikileaks calling it  embarrassing  because there is  no evidence  yet they ve been carrying on with an investigation into trumprussia collusion during the election that has not yielded an ounce of evidence but that s somehow not  embarrassing  sorry hypocrites you can t have it both ways haha shocking anonymous sources again name namesmaybe these anonymous people can work at cnn and help with fake news or i can    sean hannity seanhannity may   also tweeted about the media hypocrisy hereand if you dare ask

thoughts and prayers i m trying to find the truth as the mom dad bro asked   sean hannity seanhannity may   more attention the seth rich case gets the more the left is freaking out watch sanctimonious and as far as we know the jobless keith olbermann he lists his job as a  gq correspondent  in his twitter profile tell his massive audience on twitter only  people  liked  his video that seth rich was murdered in a  botched robbery   sorry keith bozo but when nothing of value is stolen from the body of the person you were  robbing  it s not really considered a  robbery new video if youre one of the scum selling this seth rich story to deflect from this scum trump burn in hell   keith olbermann keitholbermann may   left will stop at nothing to keep this story out of the news and to keep the focus on a trumprussia narrative that to date has not provided one shred of actual evidence to their claim  tonight could be a make it or break it night for sean hannity and his career with fox news no matter what happens on hannity s show tonight he s a hero in our eyes for at least pursuing the possibility that something other than the contrived trumprussia narrative put forth by the democrats and their allies in the media could actually be the truth here s to hannity making conservatives proud again    \n",

presidential election the white house has announced that  intelligence operatives are being ejected from the country in addition sanctions will be placed on russia s two leading intelligence services including four top officers of the military intelligence uniton thursday obama signed an executive order which grants the president the authority to impose travel bans and asset freezes on those who  tamper with alter or cause a misappropriation of information with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions the new york times reportsmr obama used that order to immediately impose sanctions on four russian intelligence officials igor valentinovich korobov the current chief of a military intelligence agency the gru and three deputies sergey aleksandrovich gizunov the deputy chief of the gru igor olegovich kostyukov a first deputy chief and vladimir stepanovich alekseyev also a first deputy chief of the gru the administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations the special technologies center a signals intelligence operation in st petersburg a firm called zor security that is also known as esage lab and the autonomous noncommercial organization professional association of designers of data processing systems whose lengthy name american officials said was cover for a group that provided special training for the hackingit is unclear at the moment how much of an impact these measures will actually have the move may end up being largely symbolic but as the times points out  the actions would amount to the strongest american response ever taken to a statesponsored cyberattack aimed at the united states us intelligence agencies including the cia fbi and department of homeland security all agree that russia was behind the dnc hacks and the subsequent slow release of damaging information obtained in those hacks during the presidential campaign they have also concluded that russia interfered with the election for one reason to help donald trump defeat hillary clintontrump has blown off the findings of the us intelligence community as  ridiculous  because the punishments obama imposed today are an executive order trump will have the option of nixing the sanctions when he takes office next month if he chooses to do so it is likely that members of congress including republicans will be furious as they have been calling for an official investigation into the matterthe white house is also planning to release a joint analytic report  from the fbi and the department of homeland security which will give more insight into the information that has been gathered by the national security agency the report is expected to be published before obama

reid asked the fbi to investigate concerns that the russian government may be attempting to undermine the us presidential election through cyber attacks that could include tampering with voting results “the prospect of a hostile government actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the cold war” reid said in a letter to fbi director james comey reid’s letter dated saturday was first obtained by the new york times and shared on its website on monday it was followed on tuesday by a letter from four democrats asking comey to assess whether campaign officials working for republican presidential candidate donald trump may be colluding with russian interests to carry out recent hacks against the democratic national committee and democratic congressional campaign committee in order to “interfere with the us presidential election” that letter was signed by representatives elijah cummings john conyers elliot engel and bennie thompson each of whom serves as the top democrat on a different congressional committee republicans control both the house of representatives and the senate comey speaking at a cyber security conference on tuesday declined to give details about what the federal bureau of investigation was probing in connection with the political hacking but indicated the agency was closely watching what foreign countries are doing “we take very seriously any effort by any actor  especially nation states that moves beyond the collection of information  and offers the prospect of an effort to influence the conduct of affairs in our country whether that is an election or something else” he said the two letters follow a spate of hacking attacks targeting us political databases including some that officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the russian government kremlin officials have denied that the fbi examined breaches in voter registration databases in illinois and arizona but did not specify who might have been behind it reid said that the threat of russian government tampering in the election was “more extensive than widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results” he also voiced concerns about possible russian government efforts to manipulate trump’s campaign ahead of the nov  election and to use it as a vehicle to advance the interests of russian president vladimir putin    \n",

   in the aftermath of the historic flooding that accompanied hurricane harvey s high winds and torrential rains there was a surprising effect on the arkema chemical plant east of houston on greens bayou the facility was inundated with so much water that it lost power and that s when the chemical reactions began when stored at improper temperatures the organic peroxides at arkema are unstable leading to  popping  sounds smoke and eventually firethose fires emitted a smoke that many in the area described differently harris county sheriff ed gonzalez said the emissions were like standing over a barbecue pit or something like that where you get smoke in your eyes  according to nbc news richard rennard a representative of arkema described what came from the plant a little more cautiously noxious certainly i don t know the composition of the smokea deputy was in fact taken to the hospital after inhaling the fumes coming from the plantbut after officials warned everyone in a nearly twomile radius that more explosions could follow questions about whether the plant was following proper safety protocols began to arise that s when arkema s connection to the trump epa came to lightthe international business times got their hands on federal records that showed arkema successfully lobbied epa chief scott pruitt and a number of republicans in an effort to delay new safety regulations for chemical plants that were passed by the obama administration those rules crafted after the chemical plant disaster in west texas  miles from houston would have taken effect in march they also would have directly affected arkemain their letter opposing the new regulations arkema used standard conservative trope that the rules would  likely add significant new costs and burdens to the corporate audit process  those costs of course would be on top of the more than  in osha fines assessed to the crosby arkema plant this year alone all for  serious  violations but it was nonetheless arkema s conclusion that  the final rule includes a litany of costly changes that have not been shown to increase safety that seems a little less than true at this pointalthough texas governor greg abbott has blocked public access to state records of just what chemicals are stored in which facilities the ap reported that the arkema plant also housed sulfur dioxide and methylpropen which are respectively toxic and flammable storage of these chemicals would have required arkema to file a risk management plan with the epa   which would have triggered the new obamaera rulesif trump

should be rushed off to the market as soon as possible is a growing belief among conservative  christians if you have heard of the duggar family you ve likely heard of the quiverfull movement they belong to which requires christians to have as many kids as possible which is why the duggars have  childrenbut there is another part of the quiverfull movement that is even creepierone quiverfull ministry not only pushes couples to pop out kids like rabbits they preach that fathers should farm the girls like crops such as apples and give them over to men as early as possible in other words this christian fundamentalist movement believe in child marriage like the ones americans often are horrified by when we hear stories of little girls being married off to middleaged men in the middle easttheir website is called  let them marry  and one of the first things you would see is a tree shaped missive comparing little girls to apples that must be picked early by the farmerfather and provided to men who are  in need girls are like apples on trees their fathers are the farmers whose job is to care for them he must protect his apples from pests and disease he must guard them against thieves who may pick his apples prematurely neither those at the top nor those at the bottom can help their location but when each reaches peak ripeness it is the farmer s job to harvest that fruit and give it to whom he will to those in need so there is nothing wrong with the apples still on the tree and nothing wrong with the boys who seek them but it is the farmer s duty to provide for both in due season here s the image via raw storya quote from the group leader vaughn ohlman makes it clear that this pedophilia comes not from the legalization of samesex marriage like conservatives constantly claim but directly from religious fanaticism which former quiverfull member vyckie garrison describes as a  gross  ideology combined with the christian purity movement in which  the value of a young woman is in her virginity   a consumable commodity owned by her future husband kept in trust by daddy we believe that not only should most people marry they should marry in their youth the bible speaks of the  wife of thy youth  prov  is  mal  and  children of the youth  ps  scripture also speaks of not letting children pass the flower of their age  cor    leaving the physically mature young man struggling with fornication and leaving the physically mature young woman wallowing in fruitless barren celibacy these are both unscriptural and ungodly actionsin short this conservative christian group is a haven for pedophiles who are trying to use religious liberty to justify their sickening desire to marry and rape little girlsjust another example of the christian sharia law conservatives are trying to force down our throats featured image from pixabay   \n",

about sean hannity s investigation into the murder of seth rich and the possibility that he was the dnc leakerfrom fox newson may  a story was posted on the fox news website on the investigation into the  murder of dnc staffer seth rich the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting upon appropriate review the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removedwe will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warrantedafter fox news disavowed the seth rich story liberal rag  the daily beast  published a story with unnamed sources at fox news who were  embarrassed  by sean hannity pursuing this story claiming he had  no evidence sean hannity retweeted their baseless nameless story herevery interesting my heart is not troubled in the least night all   sean hannity seanhannity may   s interesting how leftist publications are circling conservative media like a bunch of vultures trying to shut down anyone who questions the seth rich   dnc emails connection to wikileaks calling it  embarrassing  because there is  no evidence  yet they ve been carrying on with an investigation into trumprussia collusion during the election that has not yielded an ounce of evidence but that s somehow not  embarrassing  sorry hypocrites you can t have it both ways haha shocking anonymous sources again name namesmaybe these anonymous people can work at cnn and help with fake news or i can    sean hannity seanhannity may   also tweeted about the media hypocrisy hereand if you dare ask an honest question now its a conspiracy theory with no proof greatest hypocrisy ever stay tuned busy week   sean hannity seanhannity may   hannity to his credit has stayed the course and is sticking his neck out to get the truth out about seth rich only a few hours ago hannity tweeted about his bombshell announcement about seth rich tonight and curiously he also tweeted about his  future at fox  who s pulling the strings at fox these days huge announcement tonight about seth rich trumprussian collusion corrupt media the liberal effort to silence me and my future at fox  sean hannity seanhannity may   george soros get to the liberal murdoch brothers it would appear that hannity may be suggesting they are in this tweeti said publicly over and over to the rich family they are in my thoughts and prayers i m trying to find the truth as the mom dad bro asked   sean hannity seanhannity may   more attention the seth rich case gets the more the left is freaking out watch sanctimonious and as far as we know the jobless keith olbermann he lists his job as a  gq correspondent  in his twitter profile tell his massive audience on twitter only  people  liked  his video that seth rich was murdered in a  botched robbery   sorry keith bozo but when nothing of value is stolen from the body of the person you were  robbing  it s not really considered a  robbery new video if youre one of the scum selling this seth rich story to deflect from this scum trump burn in hell   keith olbermann keitholbermann may   left will stop at nothing to keep this story out of the news and to keep the focus on a trumprussia narrative that to date has not provided one shred of actual evidence to their claim  tonight could be a make it or break it night for sean hannity and his career with fox news no matter what happens on hannity s show tonight he s a hero in our eyes for at least pursuing the possibility that something other than the contrived trumprussia narrative put forth by the democrats and
